## Introduction

The Last of Us is a popular video game and TV show that centers around a post-apocalyptic world where a fungal infection has turned humans into infected creatures. In this report, we will be comparing the different levels of infected from the game/show using a plot that displays the frequency and difficulty of each level alongside its respective image.

## Loading Libraries

To start, we need to load the necessary packages to create our plot. We will be using the `tidyverse`, `imager`, and `ggimage`.


```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
# Libraries -----------------------------
#install.packages("imager")
library("tidyverse") # for data manipulation and plotting
library("imager") # for image loading and manipulation
library("ggimage") # for displaying images in ggplot2
library("ggplot2") # for plotting
library("scales") # for scaling axes
library("grid")
library("here")
```

## Creating Data

Next, we need to load the data and organize it in a data.frame that includes the stage, difficulty, frequency, and image data. We will also specify the path to the directory containing the images, load the images, and store them in a list.

```{r}
# Create Data -----------------------------

# Define the path to the image folder
path <- "/Users/solis/Desktop/GradSchool/second_semester/Computer_Modeling/Solis/Goodplot_Badplot/Data/Character_images/"

# Get a list of all the file names in the image folder
all_files <- list.files(path = path, pattern = ".png", full.names = TRUE)

# Load the images and store them in a list
image_list <- lapply(all_files, imager::load.image)
```

### Data Table

```{r}

# Define a data frame to hold the image information
image_df <- data.frame(
  stage = c("Runner", "Stalker", "Clicker", "Bloater", "Shambler", "Rat_King"), # define the stage names
  difficulty = c(1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6), # define the difficulty levels
  frequency = c(100, 120, 160, 140, 80, 20), # define the frequency of appearance
  image_path = all_files # define the path to the image files
)

# Define a function to map random numbers to difficulty levels
random_frequency <- function(difficulty) {
  lower <- difficulty * 10
  upper <- difficulty * 20
  frequency <- runif(1, lower, upper)
  return(frequency)
}

# Generate random frequencies based on the difficulty level
image_df$frequency <- sapply(image_df$difficulty, random_frequency)

image_df

```

## Creating Plots

Now that we have our data organized, we can create our plot using ggplot and ggimage

### Bad Plot

The bad plot shows the frequency of infected based on stage, but the overlapping images and text make it difficult to read and interpret the data. The images and text overlap each other, which makes it difficult to identify the different stages and their corresponding frequencies. In addition, the plot lacks a clear title and axis labels, which makes it challenging to understand the data presented.

```{r}

#bad plot ---------------------------
# Use ggplot2 to create a scatter plot with multiple images per point
bad_plot <- ggplot(image_df, aes(x = difficulty, y = frequency)) + # Add images with some jitter for legibility
  geom_image(aes(image = image_path), size = 0.2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.5, height = 10)) +
  geom_image(aes(image = image_path), size = 0.2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.5, height = -10)) + # Add text labels with some overlap checks for legibility
  geom_text(aes(label = stage), size = 4, nudge_y = 75, check_overlap = TRUE, angle = 45, color = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = stage), size = 4, nudge_x = -75, check_overlap = TRUE, angle = 135, color = "red") + # Adjust x and y axes limits, breaks, and labels
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-1, 8), breaks = seq(0, 9, by = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 160), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 200, by = 25),
                     name = "Frequency", 
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 2, name = "Difficulty")) + # Add plot title and axis labels
  labs(title = "Number of Times Infected Appears",
       x = "Difficulty and Stage", y = "") + # Adjust plot theme elements for legibility
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "red"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "purple"),
        axis.line = element_line(size = 1, color = "black"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, color = "black", angle = 90),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, color = "black"),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 13, color = "black"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, color = "black"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray90"))
  

# Output the plot
bad_plot
ggsave(here("Goodplot_Badplot", "Output", "bad_plot.png"), width = 7, height = 5)

```

### Good Plot

The good plot shows the frequency of appearance of infected stages in the video game, with each stage represented by an image. The x-axis displays the different stages, and the y-axis shows the frequency of appearance. The images are spread out and aligned with each stage, and a transparent bar is added to emphasize the frequency of appearance of each stage. The legend also displays the different stages with their corresponding colors. Overall, the good plot provides a clear and organized visualization of the data, making it easy to identify the frequency of appearance of each infected stage in the video game.


```{r}
#good plot ----------------------------

# Define custom color palette
my_colors <- c("#F0A800", "#FFD480", "#FFFFBF", "#A0C8FF", "#0070C0", "tan")

# Use ggplot2 to create a scatter plot with multiple images per point
good_plot <- ggplot(image_df, aes(x = stage, y = frequency, fill = stage)) +
  # Add a transparent bar for each stage
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", alpha = 0.3) +
  # Add images with some jitter for legibility
  geom_image(aes(image = image_path), size = 0.15, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1)) +
  # Adjust x and y axes limits, breaks, and labels
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Infected Stage") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 200), breaks = seq(0, 200, by = 20), expand = c(0, 0), name = "Frequency of Appearance") +
  # Add plot title and axis labels
  labs(title = "Frequency of Infected Based on Stage", x = NULL, y = NULL)

# Output the plot
good_plot
ggsave(here("Goodplot_Badplot", "Output", "good_plot.png"), width = 7, height = 5)
